**PdOB** is a series of abstractions for quickly creating an **OpenStageControl** .json file with GUI elements exported from an existing **PureData patch**. 

Once created, the script has to be executed by the OpenStageControl server, and enables the control of the PureData patch from a **browser-based client interface**, such as Chrome, Firefox, on any target platform (desktop, IPad, Android), via local networking.

## Current supported widgets :
